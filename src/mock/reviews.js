			'Good hospitality by Manager Ravi, nice ambience specially at evening and night. We stayed for 2 nights. The food in the cafe is good. They are developing their hotel. We enjoyed dinner at sea shore watching the spectacular views of sea at night. '

			"This is the excellent place to stay in Gokarna if you are a nature lover and love peace and serenity. Great location as it's just couple of steps away from Gokarna beach and you can actually hear sound of waves from your room. Staff (especially Mahadev ji) was very helpful and tried his best to made our stay wonderful. Laundry and wifi services are also available. Rooms were near and clear. Also, Other beaches are just few km away where you can easily trek to."
